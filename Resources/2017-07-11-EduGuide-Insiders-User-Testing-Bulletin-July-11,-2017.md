# EduGuide Insiders

## User Testing Bulletin

**July 11, 2017**

One of our ongoing projects has been to migrate our live website over to a new server which will be faster and more robust. I am looking for help with testing our new staging site before we migrate everything over to the live site. This will involve testing almost everything on the site.

We will be tracking issues inside a project on [Github](https://github.com/EGInsiders/NewStaging072017) and I'll be posting testing [scripts here](https://eduguideinsiders.gitbooks.io/test-staging/content/). When youâ€™re able to participate, just log into the staging site at http://staging.eduguide.org, follow the scripts or run tests of features on your own, and then log issues or questions in the Github project.

You will also need to join the staging site by going to http://staging.eduguide.org.

Report any issues that you observe, but for the sake of the migration.

 

If you have questions, contact me on Slack or send email to [jon@eduguide.org](mailto:jon@eduguide.org).
