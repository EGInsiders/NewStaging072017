# Testing EduGuide Path Functionality

## EduGuide Over the next few slides we're going to have you test some of the features in the system the students will be using. Please make sure you are testing on a typical device a student may use and the same network connection they will be using. If you are not, please exit the Path using the menu which can be opened with the icon to the top left and try again from an appropriate device. The purpose of this exercise is to make sure the students will be able to use the system as expected.
