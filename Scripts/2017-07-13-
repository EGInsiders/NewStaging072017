# Synchronizing addition of text attachments

## Select Core learning Path

When I click {Core Learning}

Then I'm taken to the manage dashboard for the {Core Learning} Path

#/##

## Filter for Secondary Student

When I select {Secondary Student} from the User Type drop down field

Then the page changes to show only students' activities

## Select {Can you Feel it?}

When I click on "Manage" next to “Can You Feel it?”

Then I am taken to the Manage dashboard for {Can you feel it?}

## Add Additional Content to Step

When I click Edit next to a step

Then I am taken to the edit page for that step

## Add Additional Content to the step

When I change the step type

And add additional text to the additional text field

And click "Sync most changes to child versions"

And click "Save"

Then I am taken to the activity dashboard

And the system responds, "Path step has been saved. Changes have been applied to all child versions"

And the child step displays the same additional content when viewed by a user assigned to that child version of the activity
