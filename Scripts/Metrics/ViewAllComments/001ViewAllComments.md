I zoomed in on Maddie Beltnick's path
then viewed all comments for the activity "The Road to Success Passes Through Failure."
Next, I changed the filters so that I should be shown only the comments posted by coaches.

The results are showing members who are on the team as students/members. When I selected the group filter to other groups in the list, the results (users shown) didn't match the list of members for that same group when I applied the filter in the metrics page.
