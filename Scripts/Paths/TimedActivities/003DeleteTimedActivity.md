# Delete Timed Activity

Given that I am viewing the Timed Activity dashboard
When I click on "Delete" next to the timed activity that I want to delete {Proin consequat}
Then the system responds, "Are you sure? / You're about to do something you might not be able to undo."

When I click "Ok"
Then the Timed Activity is deleted
