# Your Path to Growth

## 1

EduGuide Welcome to your EduGuide Demo. This is a short introduction to our platform and activities designed to build core noncognitive, social-emotional skills that lead to higher achievement. 

Try to answer the questions thoughtfully; only EduGuide staff will be able to see your responses, and we may jump in with a follow up question to give you a feel for how the mentoring part of the program works.

EduGuide Let’s check out this video from the 1992 Olympics about sprinting champion Derek Redmond.

EduGuide What do you think people admire about Derek Redmond in this video?

(Demo note: all EduGuide response steps include a word requirement. You can set it higher or lower depending on your students' abilities and how much you want them to write. We've left it on at a default level for this demo so you get the full student experience.)

duGuide Many people say they admire Derek’s grit: the ability to stay focused on long term goals and overcome any obstacles that get in the way.

Grit enabled him to look pain in the face and persevere, not just in the race, but every day at practice when he pushed himself to go faster. It’s why people admire Derek Redmond so much. Even his failure brought out his greatness, because he never gave up. When things didn’t go as planned he was able to adapt and persist.

EduGuide Thinking about your own life, how would you like to be more like Derek?

EduGuide How would you like to be more like Derek’s father?

EduGuide EduGuide's activities are about helping you find your own path to greatness in life, no matter what you face. You’ll learn the strategies that athletes, performers and leaders in all walks of life use to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals — so you can achieve yours.

We call these strategies core learning skills. They are the core factors in how quickly you can learn to accomplish practically anything in school and life. And like core muscles, they give you strength to stand up to challenges.

EduGuide Ultimately these activities are about equipping you to help others find their greatness too, just like Derek’s father did for his son through the years.

EduGuide EduGuide will train you to mentor people around you: friends, family members and others.

You’ll learn the keys to helping people grow to their potential, which is what mentoring is all about.You’ll also be given regular opportunities to improve your mentoring skills. You’ll practice by mentoring a character named “Quinn.” You can picture Quinn as a younger version of yourself.

EduGuide It won’t always be easy, but the more effort you put into thinking about these activities, the faster you’ll grow to realize the fullness of what you were meant to be. It’s going to be a rewarding journey.

## 11

EduGuide So, let’s get started mentoring by giving Quinn a little advice. Imagine you could write a note to yourself when you were younger. What would you say?

## 12

EduGuide Challenge: In each activity, we share one challenge you can choose to take on if you want to see greater growth. This week, don’t try to change anything. But as you or others run into obstacles, think about what Derek Redmond would do if he were in your shoes.
