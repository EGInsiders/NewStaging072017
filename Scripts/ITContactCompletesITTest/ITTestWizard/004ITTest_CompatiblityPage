## IT Contact views Compatibility page

When I view the compatibility page
Then a checkmark or an x appears next to "Javascript Supported"
And "Cookies supported"
And "AJAX Supported"
And "HINCLUDE Supported"
And "All Tests have completed successfully"
And I am taken to the "Test" page when I click "Continue"
