# Delete a Library Resource

When I hover over the upper left corner of a resource thumbnail {TIE Fighter Remastered}
and the popup menu appears
Then I click "Delete"
And the system responds, "Are you sure you want to delete this content from the team?"
And I click "Ok"
And the system responds, "Item successfully deleted from the team library."
